All the relevant information can be obtained by entering the name in the input field depending on the active filter.</p>

<br>
<strong>Home Screen</strong><br>
After leaving the Welcome Screen, you may apply a filter from the bottom bar for your searches<br>
An input field in the top of the screen allows you to enter the name of the character(s), episode(s) or dimension(s) that you wish to find. Next to this field, there is a "shearch" button and a "cancel" button that will revert everything back to square one.<br>
After a search is made, the results are shown in a slider box below the input field and they are displayed in cards. Those cards are pressable and will show you more detailed information!.<br>
And that's it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Live long and prosper</strong> üññ</p>
